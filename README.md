# 🎬 Movie Recommender System 🎥
content based recommender

Discover movies you'll love with the **Movie Recommender System**! This project uses machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user input.

## 🌟 Features
- **Search Functionality:** Type or select your favorite movie to get similar movie recommendations.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides a list of top 5 movies based on cosine similarity.
- **Interactive UI:** Built using Streamlit for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Movie Details:** Recommendations include details like director, hero, and release year.

## 🚀 Live Demo
Check out the live demo of the application here:  
👉 [Movie Recommender System](https://movie-recommender-5o2w.onrender.com)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** 
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Data Processing:** Cosine similarity and CountVectorizer
- **Deployment:** Render

## 📚 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Datasets from TMDB are merged and processed to extract meaningful tags for each movie.
   - Tags include genres, keywords, cast, and director names.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - A combined `tags` column is vectorized using `CountVectorizer`.
   - Cosine similarity is calculated for movie comparisons.
3. **Recommendation System:**
   - The user selects a movie, and the system recommends the top 5 similar movies.

## 🖥️ Running the Project Locally
